<h2 id="notes">Notes:</h2>

<p>5/19/2014: Made this for the first time, with cumin and coriander added to the spices above. They didn&#39;t seem to fit, so I didn&#39;t document them in the recipe (all the spices were improvised anyway). We ate this in pita pockets, with cucumber/lettuce/tomato salad. The mint and EVOO added at the table are absolutely essential. The salad was a good base for the eggplant and the cucumbers went well with everything else.</p>
